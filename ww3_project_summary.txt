Project Overview
---------------
WW3 is a Risk-based strategy game built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, running in a browser via Live Server. It features a 1920x1080 map (STAGE.WEBP) with 42 territories, supporting 2-6 players. Players deploy armies, play cards, and manage territories. The game is in development, with the initial deployment phase and card play partially implemented.

Current State
-------------
- **Welcome Screen**:
  - Displays "Welcome to WW3" with "Start Game" and "Load Game" buttons (blue, centered, 4vw/1.5vw fonts).
  - Clicking "Start Game" transitions to the login screen.
  - Location: index.html (#welcome)
- **Login Screen**:
  - Blue background (#007bff), black Arial 16pt text, dropdown for 2-6 players.
  - Players enter names and select unique colors (red, blue, pink, yellow, green, black).
  - Stable dropdown, names enable colors, no duplicate colors.
  - Submits to game screen with randomized player order.
  - Location: index.html (#login)
- **Game Screen**:
  - **Map**:
    - Displays STAGE.WEBP (1920x1080, scales to screen, e.g., 1366x768).
    - 42 territories with player-colored ellipses, numbers (pink: black, others: white, 24px, bold, black outline).
    - Stats overlay in top ~1400x100px (white box, black border, black 21px text):
      - Guido: "X Cards, Y Territories, Z Armies, Continents – Name, Name" (x=10, y=31).
      - Nooch: Same format (x=700, y=31).
      - Karl: Below Guido (x=10, y=51).
      - Mickey: Below Nooch (x=700, y=51).
      - Deck: "W Cards left in the Deck, V Wildcards played" (x=10, y=71).
      - Continents: "Continents next payoff: Australia 2, South America 2, Africa 3, North America 5, Europe 5, Asia 7" (x=10, y=91).
    - No overlap with territories (e.g., Greenland at y=186).
    - Location: index.html (#map), game.js (updateStats)
  - **Panel**:
    - Right side, transparent, 480x1080, contains only: prompt, bank, buttons, card panel (when active), errors.
    - No stats (continent payoffs, deck, wildcards, round).
    - Buttons: "Show Armies" (toggles yellow highlight, +X), "Reset" (restores pre-deployment), "Done" (next player if bank=0).
    - Text wraps within 480px.
    - Location: index.html (#panel)
  - **Territory Selection**:
    - Unowned territories unclickable (gray, .unowned, pointer-events: none).
    - Owned territories highlight on click (yellow stroke), deselect on re-click, Enter, or new selection.
    - Console logs: "selectTerritory called for [territory]", "Cannot select [territory]: not owned".
    - Location: game.js (selectTerritory, initializeGame), styles.css (.unowned)
  - **Keyboard Input**:
    - Select territory, type number (e.g., "10" adds 10 armies, 1→11, bank-=10).
    - Negative input (e.g., "-4" subtracts 4, 11→7, bank+=4).
    - Backspace works, Enter deselects, errors for invalid input (e.g., bank too low, armies<1).
    - Console logs: "Keyboard: [territory], input=10, delta=10, armies=11, bank=10".
    - Location: game.js (handleKeydown)
  - **Bank/Reset**:
    - Initial bank: 2 players=40, 3=35, 4=30, 5=25, 6=20, minus territories (e.g., 4 players, 10 territories: 30-10=20).
    - Reset restores pre-deployment state (e.g., bank=20, brazil=1 if unchanged from prior turn).
    - Console logs: "resetDeployment called", "Reset: [player], bank=20, territories=brazil:1,...".
    - Location: game.js (resetDeployment, startDeployment, preDeployment)
  - **Deployment**:
    - ~10 territories per player (4 players), bank correct.
    - Deploy armies via scroll (delta=±1) or keyboard, confirm when bank=0.
    - Console logs: "Start deployment for [player]: bank=20, territories=...".
    - Location: game.js (initializeGame, startDeployment)
  - **Card Play**:
    - Partial: Select cards, play book (+10 armies), skip (if <5 cards).
    - Wildcard options placeholder.
    - Location: game.js (startGame, playCard, playBook, skipCardPlay)

Resolved Issues
--------------
- **Stats Overlay**:
  - Removed from panel, moved to top-left map (initially 600x135px).
  - Fixed placement: Now ~1400x100px, Guido/Nooch/Karl/Mickey/deck/continents, black 21px text, white box, no overlap (y<100).
  - Location: game.js (updateStats), index.html (removed #panel .stats)
- **Keyboard Input**:
  - Fixed miscalculation: Input "10" adds 10 (1→11, not 10), bank-=10.
  - Deselects after Enter (valid/invalid input).
  - Location: game.js (handleKeydown)
- **Reset Button**:
  - Fixed: Restores pre-deployment bank/armies (e.g., bank=20, brazil=1, not bank=0).
  - Stores state in gameState.preDeployment at turn start.
  - Location: game.js (resetDeployment, startDeployment)
- **Territory Selection**:
  - Unowned territories unclickable (pointer-events: none).
  - Deselect on re-click, Enter, or new selection.
  - Location: game.js (selectTerritory), styles.css (.unowned)

Pending Tasks
------------
- Implement attack phase (player vs. player territory conquest).
- Implement reinforcement phase (move armies between territories).
- Implement takeover (full game mechanics).
- Implement save/load game.
- Complete wildcard card options (aerial attack, territory assignment).
- Enhance card play (e.g., auto-assign cards).
- Timeline: Start ~May 6, 2025

Testing Instructions
-------------------
1. **Save Files**:
   - Ensure files in C:\ww3\:
     - C:\ww3\index.html
     - C:\ww3\game.js
     - C:\ww3\styles.css
     - C:\ww3\images\STAGE.WEBP
   - Optional: C:\ww3\svg\stage.svg
2. **Test with Live Server**:
   - Open C:\ww3\index.html with Live Server.
   - Test:
     - **Welcome**: Readable fonts, transitions to login.
     - **Login**: Blue background, stable dropdown, unique colors.
     - **Map**: 42 territories numbered, stats overlay (~1400x100px, white box, black 21px, Guido/Nooch/Karl/Mickey/deck/continents, no overlap).
     - **Panel**: Right, 480x1080, only prompt/bank/buttons/errors, text wraps.
     - **Territory Selection**: Unowned unclickable, deselect on re-click/Enter/new selection.
     - **Numbers**: Pink black, others white, readable.
     - **Bank/Reset**: Correct bank (e.g., 4 players, 10 territories: 20), reset restores pre-deployment.
     - **Keyboard**: Input “10” adds 10 (1→11), “-4” subtracts, Backspace, deselects, correct errors.
     - **Deployment**: ~10 territories/player, bank correct.
     - **Scaling**: No scroll bars, stats in ~100px.
     - **Console**: 42 territory logs, deployment/reset/keyboard logs, no errors.
   - Share feedback:
     - Example: “Login blue, dropdown stable. All territories numbered, stats span top ~1400x100px, white box, black 21px, no overlap. Unowned unclickable, deselects correctly. Panel on right, no stats, buttons work. Bank correct, reset restores bank=20, brazil=1. Keyboard adds 10 (1→11), -4 subtracts, deselects, errors correct. No scroll bars, 1366x768. Console shows 42 territories, reset/keyboard logs, no errors.”
     - Include resolution (e.g., “1366x768, no zoom”).
     - Note bugs (e.g., “Reset sets bank to 0”).
3. **Share Summary**:
   - Save this file (e.g., C:\ww3\ww3_project_summary.txt).
   - Present to Grok 3 to resume work.
